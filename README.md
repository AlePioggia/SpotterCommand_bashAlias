# SpotterCommand_bashAlias
Here you can find 2 scripts that allows you to have a very quick access to all the files of the filesystem.

DESCRIPTION:

- SpotterCommandScript.sh -> 
This script allows you to search files in the filesystem, once you type the keyword it will find ALL the files (NOT DIRECTORIES) that are similar to the word that
you typed. The files will be sorted and shown in the terminal interface, you just need to type the number corrisponding to the file that you want to reach and my script will trasfer you in the selected file's directory.


- SpotterDirectoryScript.sh ->
Is the same as SpotterCommandScript.sh, the difference is that this one does the search with only DIRECTORIES

WATCH OUT: 

This script is intended to be used as an alias, to set it you need to open .bashrc, cut and paste spot alias from alias.txt in and you are done.
You also need to change the path to the files, according to your filesystem.

- spot -d directory_name -> in order to search through directories
- spot -f file_name -> in order to search through 
- spot -help -> will display the guidelines
